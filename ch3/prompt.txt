yo chat im gonna give something that you should work very hard to make it nice.

im gonne give you a list of problems that i want you to answer in this format:

ch3	DP - Longest Increasing Subsequence	3	studentsko

the first and second column should be: ch3 and DP - 01 Knapsack, which describe the topic of the problem. 

for the third column, you should search the web for statistics and discussions and rate the difficulty of the problem between 1, 2 and 3. 3 being the hardest in the scale.

for the fourth, do this: =HIPERLINK("https://open.kattis.com/problems/studentsko";"studentsko"). find the link of the problem (if theyre uva... then find the link from vjudge, if not, find from kattis) and link it that way.

here is my list.
